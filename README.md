# Computer_Vision_Project

A project with the Vector Institute is designed to facilitate knowledge transfer between Vector and its industry sponsors, and specifically in this project, to enhance sponsorsâ€™ skills implementing deep learning language models on large vision datasets. In this proposed project, Vector aims to provide an opportunity for sponsors to:

(1) learn about recent advances in computer vision with deep learning and vision modeling, and (2) reproduce large-scale pre-trained models.

This repository is for ongoing research on training deep learning models at scale.
