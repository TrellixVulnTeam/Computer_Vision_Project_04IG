# Computer_Vision_Project

A project with the Vector Institute is designed to facilitate knowledge transfer between Vector and its industry sponsors, and specifically in this project, to enhance sponsors’ skills implementing deep learning language models on large vision datasets. In this proposed project, Vector aims to provide an opportunity for sponsors to:

(1) learn about recent advances in computer vision with deep learning and vision modeling, and (2) reproduce large-scale pre-trained models.

This repository is for ongoing research on training deep learning models at scale.

In addition, the AI Engineering team has created a separate repository that works as a tool-kit the Computer Vision project at Vector Institute. It includes various datasets readily loadable from the shared cluster as well as useful image/video tools such as data augmentation and visualization utilities.

You can find the repository at https://github.com/VectorInstitute/vector_cv_tools

Three broader topic related approaches were explored: anomaly and semantic segmentation, two-stream neural networks and transfer learning, which were applied to five specific image and video recognition use cases. These use-cases reflected current industry needs, participants’ interests and expertise, and opportunities to translate academic advances into real-world applications

**Image Approaches**
1. Anomaly detection in manufacturing
2. Semantic and instance segmentation in aerial and road obstacle imagery

**Video Approaches**
4. Semantic segmentation in identifying clinically relevant features of interest in cholecystec-
tomy procedures (gallbladder surgery)
4. Automated traffic incident detection With two-stream neural networks
5. Transfer learning for efficient video classification and detection
